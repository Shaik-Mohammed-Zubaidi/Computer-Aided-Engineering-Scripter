Create a 10 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm cube named Cube1                             ,geometry          
Mesh Cube1 with 5 mm HEX elements                                           ,meshing           
Add a steel material (E = 210 GPa, ν = 0.3) and assign it to Cube1          ,material          
Fix the bottom face of Cube1 and apply 1000 N pressure on the top face      ,BC + load         
Create a static step called Step-1 and run the job CubeJob                  ,step + job        
Print the total number of elements in Cube1 after meshing                   ,query             
Save the model database after the job completes                             ,save MDB          
Open the job’s ODB and report the maximum von Mises stress                  ,post-proc         
Create a 50 mm diameter, 5 mm thick circular plate and mesh with 4 mm quads ,sketch + mesh     
Apply a temperature load of −50 °C to the whole plate in Step-1             ,temp load         
Create a 100 mm long, 10 mm square beam, mesh with B31 elements             ,beam              
Fix the left end of the beam and apply a 500 N tip load on the right end    ,BC + load         
Report the tip displacement in the Y direction                              ,history output    
Create a hollow cylinder (r\_in = 20 mm, r\_out = 25 mm, length = 100 mm)   ,boolean           
Seed the cylinder part with 4 mm and print the element count                ,mesh query
